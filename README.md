# Block Blast for Prizm

A simple puzzle game inspired by the original **Block Blast**, made for Casio Prizm calculators using Python Extra.

## How to Play

- The game is based on the mobile version of **Block Blast**, with a twist:
  - At any time, you have **3 blocks** to choose from.
  - Use `F1`, `F2`, `F3` to select and place **Block 1**, **Block 2**, or **Block 3**.
  - Once used, the selected block disappears.
  - When all 3 blocks are used, a new set of 3 random blocks appears.

- Move the selected block using arrow keys: `↑`, `↓`, `←`, `→`.  
- Press `EXE` or `SHIFT` to place the block.  
- Press `F6` to open the **Menu** (Replay, Resume, Exit).
